## 🧠 What is this?

A simple yet robust two-player game that features:

* **Real-time Win Detection:** Automatically identifies horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins.

* **Draw Logic:** Detects when all boxes are filled without a winner.

* **Reset & New Game:** Instantly clear the board to start over.

* **Turn Tracking:** Clearly shows which player (O or X) is currently moving.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **JavaScript:** Core game logic and DOM manipulation.

* **HTML5 & CSS3:** Clean layout and responsive grid styling.



## 📖 What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

1. **Array Mapping:** Checking winning patterns against the current board state.

2. **Event Delegation:** Handling clicks on the game grid efficiently.

3. **UI/UX State:** Disabling the board once a winner is found to prevent further moves.
