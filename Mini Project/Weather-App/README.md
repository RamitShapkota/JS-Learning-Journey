# 🌤️ Weather App
A sleek and responsive Weather application built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project demonstrates real-time data fetching using external APIs, advanced error handling, and dynamic UI updates based on weather conditions.

## ✨ Features
* **Real-Time Data:** Fetches live weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind) for any city globally.
* **Dynamic Iconography:** Weather icons change automatically to match current conditions (Clouds, Clear, Rain, etc.).
* **Optimized UX:** Supports both button clicks and "Enter" key presses for a seamless search experience.
* **Modern Error Handling:** Detects invalid city names (404) and empty inputs to guide the user.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Linear Gradients & Custom Layouts).
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) using `Async/Await` and `Fetch API`.
* **Data Source:** OpenWeatherMap API (Current Weather Data).

## 📖 What I Learned
As a learner, this project helped me master several key concepts:
1. **Asynchronous JavaScript:** Managing network requests with `async` and `await` to handle data without freezing the UI.
2. **Object Lookup (Mapping):** Replacing long `if/else` chains with a modern `icons` object for cleaner, more professional code.
3. **Template Literals:** Using backticks (`` `${}` ``) to inject dynamic values into HTML strings efficiently.
4. **Conditional UI Rendering:** Managing the `display` property of elements to toggle between error messages and weather results.
